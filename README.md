# Project_Ex_Nihilo

First concept idea of the project. - Note: exact definition of profit and caped loss will be done as soon as project has started.

The first goal is for the program to execute standard spot trading strategies with Bitcoin.
Depending on the coin’s volatility, the bot should aim a minimum profit/loss (P/L) of +10%. 
The next step is to enable leveraged trading with a maximum leverage of x50.
In this mode, the achievable P/L should be capped at ±50% to prevent a total loss.
