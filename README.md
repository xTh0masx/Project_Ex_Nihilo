The first goal is for the program to execute standard spot trading strategies with Bitcoin. Depending on the coin’s volatility, the bot should aim a minimum profit/loss (P/L) of +10%.  The next step is to enable leveraged trading with a maximum leverage of x50. In this mode, the achievable P/L should be capped at ±50% to prevent a total loss.
